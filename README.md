# OPENCV CLIP CUTTER

## Intro
When going out for a skate or BMX session, I often set up a tripod and record
it in order to analyze technique, check progression and find areas to improve. 
I then edit the clips in iMovie to remove everything but whatever trick I'm
doing. This is an attempt to automate that process. 

There are some reasons why I think a POC should not be too complicated:
- empty skatepark, no other people around
- most of the times I go out of camera between attempts, so simple motion
  tracking might suffice.
- background is static. 

I haven't done any OPENCV in many years, and never used pyhton before, so I
expect this project to be a learning ground too. 


## How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
